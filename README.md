# PingOne for Customers Mobile SDK

## Overview

PingOne for Customers Mobile SDK is a set of components and services targeted at enabling organizations to include multifactor authentication (MFA) into native applications.
This solution leverages Ping Identity’s expertise in MFA technology, as a component that can be embedded easily and quickly into a new or existing application. The PingOne for Customers Mobile SDK package comprises of the following components:

* The PingOne for Customers Mobile SDK library for iOS applications.
* A sample app example source code for iOS.
* Mobile Authentication Framework for iOS Developers (integrated into the sample app).

Release notes can be found [here](./release-notes.md).

### Documentation

Reference documentation is available for PingOne for Customers Mobile SDK, describing its capabilities, features, installation and setup, integration with mobile apps, deployment and more: 

* [PingOne for Customers Mobile SDK release notes and admin related documentation](https://docs.pingidentity.com/bundle/p14c/)
* [PingOne for Customers Mobile SDK developer documentation](https://apidocs.pingidentity.com/pingone/platform/v1/api/#mobile-sdk-api)


## Set up a mobile app using the PingOne SDK sample code

### Prerequisites

Prepare the iOS push messaging mandatory data from Apple Developer portal:

* Key ID
* Team ID
* Token .p8 file
* Bundle ID

Refer to: [Establishing a Token-Based Connection to APNs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/establishing_a_token-based_connection_to_apns).


### Configure iOS push messaging on the PingOne Portal

#### iOS Push Notification:

When configuring your PingOne SDK application in the PingOne admin web console (**Connections > Applications > {NATIVE application} > Edit > Authenticator**), you should upload your .p8 token and fill in the Key ID, Team ID and Bundle ID. See [Edit an application](https://documentation.pingidentity.com/pingone/p14cAdminGuide/index.shtml#p1_t_editApplication.html) in the administration guide.



### Xcode integration

**Note:** PingOne SDK supports the following software versions:

* Xcode 11 and above.
* iOS 10.0 and above.


#### Add the PingOne SDK component into your existing project

1. In your **Project Navigator**, click on your target, and drag **PingOne.xcframework** to **Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**.
2. Check the **Copy items if needed** checkbox.

3. Integrate the PingOne SDK component into your code:
	* Import the framework into your application initialization code:<br>`import PingOne`

### Pairing

To manually pair the device, call the following method with your pairing key:

```swift
@objc public static func pair(_ pairingKey: String, completionHandler: @escaping (NSError?) -> Void)
```

To automatically pair the device using OpenID Connect:

1. call this function to get the PingOne SDK mobile payload:
```swift
@objc public static func generateMobilePayload() throws -> String
```
2. pass the received mobile payload on the OIDC request as the value of query param: `mobilePayload`
3. call this function with the ID token after the OIDC authentication completes:
```swift
@objc public static func processIdToken(_ idToken: String, completionHandler: @escaping (_ pairingObject: PairingObject?, _ error: NSError?) -> Void)
```

### Working with push messages in iOS

This section details the steps needed in order to work with push messages in iOS:

* Enable **Push Notifications**: Go to your Project Navigator’s **capabilities** tab. Select **Push Notifications > Enable**.
* Enable **Remote Notifications**: Go to your Project Navigator’s **capabilities** tab. Turn on **Background Modes > Remote notifications**.
* Enable **Push Notifications** in your **Apple Developer Account > Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles > Identifiers > Capabilities > Push Notifications > Enable** and upload your p8 key.
* Enter your app’s **Deployment Details** settings in your **Apple Developer Account > Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles > Identifiers > Your App ID.** These details are now mandatory prerequisites for Apple to register your device for push notifications.

#### Register device token on PingOne server

In order to receive push notifications from PingOne SDK, use the following code in your `didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken` call, passing the deviceToken as is:

```swift
@objc public static func setDeviceToken(_ deviceToken: Data, type: APNSDeviceTokenType, completionHandler: @escaping (_ error: NSError?) -> Void)
```

### Handling Push Notifications

PingOne SDK will only handle push notifications which were issued by the PingOne SDK server. For other push notifications, `NSError` with the code `10002, unrecognizedRemoteNotification` will be returned.

The `APNSDeviceTokenType` should be set like this:

```swift
var deviceTokenType : PingOne.APNSDeviceTokenType = .production
#if DEBUG
deviceTokenType = .sandbox
#endif
```

Inside the following AppDelegate method:

```swift
optional func application(_ application: UIApplication,
didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [AnyHashable : Any],
fetchCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> Void)
```

Call:

```swift
@objc public static func processRemoteNotification(_ userInfo: [AnyHashable : Any], completionHandler: @escaping (_ notificationObject: NotificationObject?, _ error: NSError?) -> Void)
```

and pass it the `userInfo` as is.

#### Push Notifications Categories:

PingOne SDK uses categories for different notifications. If your app already uses categories, you will need to retrieve the PingOne SDK categories `Set<UNNotificationCategory>`, by calling:    

```swift
@objc public static func getUNNotificationCategories() -> Set<UNNotificationCategory>
```

and add them to your current categories, for example:

```swift
let center  = UNUserNotificationCenter.current()
center.delegate = self
center.requestAuthorization(options: [.sound, .alert, .badge]) { (granted, error) in
    if error == nil
    {
        // Registering UNNotificationCategory more than once results in previous categories being overwritten. PingOne provides the needed categories. The developer may add categories.
        UNUserNotificationCenter.current().setNotificationCategories(PingOne.getUNNotificationCategories())
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()
        }
    }
}
```


#### Localization

The following keys are returned by the PingOne SDK Remote Notification, with suggested localization:

```swift
"notification.confirm"  = "Approve";
"notification.deny"     = "Deny";
"notification.message"  = "You have a new authentication request.";
"notification.title"    = "New Authentication";
```

**Note:** An example of these keys is provided in the sample app, in the `Localizable.strings` file.

### Keychain Sharing

**Note:** This step is required only if your app uses Keychain Sharing.
Make sure that the first item on your Keychain Groups is `YOUR_BUNDLE_ID` (your private keychain group). This requirement will ensure that the SDK keychain values are private, and are not shared between apps​:

#### Mobile Authentication Framework

The following method starts an authentication process when the user taps "Authentication API" on the main screen. The authentication process is completed by the PingFederate Authentication API.

**Note:** Before running this method, you need to update your `oidcIssuer` and `clientId` in the Config.swift class. See [Authentication API for Developers Mobile iOS code](https://github.com/pingidentity/mobile-authentication-framework-ios)

```swift
func authenticate(With payload: String){
    authnUI.authenticate(presenter: self, payload: payload, dynamicData: "") { [weak self] (serverPayload, accessToken, error) in
        guard let self = self else { return }
        
        if (serverPayload.count > 0) { //Need pairing
           PingOne.processIdToken(serverPayload) { (pairingObject, error) in
               self.stopLoadingAnimation()
               if let pairingObject = pairingObject{
                   self.displayNotificationViewAlert(pairingObject)
               }
               else if let error = error{
                   print(error.localizedDescription)
               }
           }
        } else {
           self.stopLoadingAnimation()
        }
    }
}
```

### PingOne Mobile SDK sample app

The PingOne Mobile SDK bundle provides a sample app that includes all the basic flows in order to help you get started.

### Send logs

```swift
// Call this method if you want to send logs to the PingOne support team.
PingOne.sendLogs { (supportId, error) in
    if let supportId = supportId{
        print("Support ID:\(supportId)")
        }
    }
    else if let error = error{
        print("error sending logs: \(error.debugDescription)")
    }
}
```
